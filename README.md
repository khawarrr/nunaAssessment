#### Disclaimer!!!

Recently cypress came out with version 10 which brings some changes, but these changes are only to cypress interface and different files/folders naming. However, it came out with a lot of compatibility issues with 3rd party plugins and bugs so it is still recommended to use version 9.7 as most stable version.
